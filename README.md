# Sales and Customer Dashboard Using Tableau

This repository contains interactive dashboards for visualizing sales and customer data for a US-based company. The dashboards are designed to provide insights into sales performance, customer trends, and other relevant metrics. Users can easily navigate between the customer and sales dashboards using interactive buttons, and can also filter results by year, product(s), location, time period, top customer(s), and so on. Furthermore, a user can easily switch between the two dashboards using buttons. Below is the screenshot of the two interactive dashboards. You can also find other screenshots in the Screenshot folder. Please download the [Tableau file](https://github.com/srheegit/Sales-and-Customer-Dashboard-Using-Tableau/blob/main/Sales%20and%20Customer%20Dashboard.twb) to interact with the dashboard.

## Key Insights between 2022 and 2023

### Sales Data

#### General Trends
- Both the year 2022 and 2023 saw a steady increase in sales and the total quantity sold from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, with the peak performance of both years in November, in both the total sales amount and the total quantity of products sold.
- In total *profit*, however, we see that the most profitable months lie in the middle of the year, and see a dip in profit in April and October.
- In terms of product categories, chairs are products with one of the most sales for both years, while bookcases has the lowest sales and one of the lowest profit for both years. There was decrease in profit from chairs in 2023 compared with 2022.
- Accessories remain the most profitable category for both years.

#### Difference between 2022 and 2023
- There was noticeable increase in the total number of sold items at the end of the year in 2023 compared to 2022, but both the sales and the profit remained relatively unchanged for the same two periods.
- There were more fluctuation in profit toward the the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.
- We saw a dramtic increase in both sales and profit (up $11K) from accessories in 2023 compared to 2022.

### Customer Data

#### General Trends
- The total number of customers and the total orders increased steadily for both years as we moved from January to December.
- The average sales per customer remained relatively static throughout both years.
- The majority of customers made 1 - 4 orders, with most people making 2 orders.

## Recommanded actions and next steps
- Investigate the reason why we did not see an increase in profit toward the end of both years even though we saw an increase in both sales and quanity sold. We can take a look at composition of sales - it could be that, in terms of percentage of total sales, we see lower-profit-margin products sell more toward the end of the years and higher-profit-margin products sell less toward the end of the years.
- Consider whether it's a good strategy to focus less on selling bookcases, as they sell least and does not generate much profit
