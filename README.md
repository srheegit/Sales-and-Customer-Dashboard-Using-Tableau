# Sales and Customer Dashboard Using Tableau

This repository contains interactive dashboards for visualizing sales and customer data for a US-based company. The dashboards are designed to provide insights into sales performance, customer trends, and other relevant metrics. Users can easily navigate between the customer and sales dashboards using interactive buttons, and can also filter results by year, product(s), location, time period, top customer(s), and so on. Furthermore, a user can easily switch between the two dashboards using buttons. Below is the screenshot of the two interactive dashboards. You can also find other screenshots in the Screenshot folder. Please download the [Tableau file](https://github.com/srheegit/Sales-and-Customer-Dashboard-Using-Tableau/blob/main/Sales%20and%20Customer%20Dashboard.twb) to interact with the dashboard yourself :)
